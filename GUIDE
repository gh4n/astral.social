# SSH Forwarding

1. test on local machine

```
$ ssh -T git@github.com
# Attempt to SSH in to github
> Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide
> shell access.
```

2. add config to ~/.ssh/ssh_config

```
Host <example.com>
  ForwardAgent yes
```

3. test on remote

```
$ echo "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK"
# Print out the SSH_AUTH_SOCK variable
> /tmp/ssh-4hNGMk8AZX/agent.79453
```

if the variable is not set then ssh forwarding is not working

with a variable set, test connection to github

```
$ ssh -T git@github.com
# Attempt to SSH in to github
> Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide
> shell access.
```
